# Subtractors

Verilog designs for half and full subtractors. Example test benches illustrate the difference between borrowing and no borrow.

Files:
- `Subtractor.v` – Basic single‑bit subtractor
- `full_subtractor.v` – Full subtractor with borrow in/out

Use the provided test benches (`half_subtractor_tb.v`, `full_subtractor_Testbench.v`) to simulate in ModelSim.
