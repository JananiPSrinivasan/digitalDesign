# Combinatorial Circuits

Examples of arithmetic and logic blocks that do not rely on clock edges. Folders in this directory include adders, subtractors, encoders/decoders, comparators and a simple ALU. Most subdirectories provide ModelSim scripts so you can quickly simulate each module.

```
ALU/            - 8â€‘bit arithmetic logic unit
adders/         - Half, full and tree adders
subtractors/    - Half and full subtractor examples
Comparator/     - Parameterized magnitude comparator
Decoders/       - Binary and parameterized decoders
```

Navigate to an individual folder and run its simulation script to see waveforms.
