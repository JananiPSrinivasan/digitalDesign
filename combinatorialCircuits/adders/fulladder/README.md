# Full Adder

Implements a singleâ€‘bit full adder. The test bench `full_adder_tb.v` applies sample vectors and prints the sum and carry outputs.

To run the simulation in ModelSim:

```bash
vsim -do run_fulladder.tcl  # adjust script name if needed
```

The design can be extended or instantiated in larger adders.
