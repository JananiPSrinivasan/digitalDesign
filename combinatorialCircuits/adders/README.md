# Adders

Collection of simple adder implementations used for learning basic arithmetic hardware design.

* `halfadder/` – Half adder structural and behavioral models
* `fulladder/` – Full adder with test bench
* `treeadder/` – Four‑bit tree adder example (includes existing README)

Each folder contains Verilog sources and a ModelSim TCL script (`run_*.tcl`) to compile and simulate the design.
