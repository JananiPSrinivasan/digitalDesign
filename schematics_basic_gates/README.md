# Basic Gate Schematics

Cadence schematic files and test benches for standard logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) as well as small example circuits such as inverters and ring oscillators.

These directories are intended for use with Cadence Virtuoso. They include library data (`data.dm`, `schematic/`, `symbol/`) plus test benches for simulation.
