# Digital Design

This repository contains small Verilog modules and schematics demonstrating
fundamental concepts in digital design and VLSI.

## Repository Structure
- `verilogBasics/` – Simple “Hello world” programs for learning Verilog syntax
  (datatypes, operators, slicing, etc.). Each folder contains simulation scripts.
- `combinatorialCircuits/` – Examples such as adders, subtractors, encoders,
  decoders, comparators, multiplexers, and a simple ALU. Many subfolders include
  ModelSim TCL scripts for running simulations.
- `sequentialCircuits/` – Clock‑related designs (e.g., `clockGenAndDist`) with a
  detailed README describing clock division, gating, DLL/CDR concepts, and more.
- `schematics_basic_gates/` – Cadence schematics and testbenches for gates like
  NAND, NOR, XOR, and basic circuits such as inverters and ring oscillators.
