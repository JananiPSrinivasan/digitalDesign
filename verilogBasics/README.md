# Verilog Basics

This directory contains small Verilog programs that demonstrate key language features such as datatypes, operators, bit slicing and replication. Each `.v` file focuses on a specific concept so you can experiment with the syntax.

To try the examples with ModelSim:

```bash
vsim -do run_sim.tcl
```

The `run_sim.tcl` script compiles `vectorbitslicing.v` and runs a short simulation. You can modify the script to compile any of the other examples.
